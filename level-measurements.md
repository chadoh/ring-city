Level Measurements
==================

With each level of the ring city being narrower than the one below, it would also require less height while maintaining similar penetration of natural light. Here's a possibility for the **thickness** (from outer wilderness to inner park) and **height** (from the floor of one level to the floor of the next) for each level of the structure. Keep in mind that we require 2m below the floor of each level for vegetation-supporting soil, food production, and other uses.
